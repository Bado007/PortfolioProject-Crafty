## Testing 

Tests were performed both for HTML and CSS. 


### HTML testing

- I encountered an error while organizing the structure of the code. It notified me that I was missing a closing tag of my code. The issue was resolved.
- I noticed an issue with empty elemnts and a SUGGESTIONS  of replacing H1 elements with H2.
- I used a [W3C](https://validator.w3.org) website to test my code for ERRORS.

### CSS testing

I noticed that some lines of code weren't executed because of closing brackets or missing ";" on the end of the code. The website notified me where the issue is, and I implement the change. I ran it again and received a notification of no Errors.

- For testing CSS code i used [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator.

## Bugs

I encountered many bugs along the way. Majority is resolved, but few remains:
- Footer on the service page is not Bottom-aligned
- Calls to action don't have a dotted underline when hovered over
- Responsiveness of main pageÂ 
- Alignment of elements on home page when screen size changed

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
